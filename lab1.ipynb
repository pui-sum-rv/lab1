        "In this lab, you'll get familiar with image color spaces. On the web and in general usage, most images are encoded as **RGB**: **R**ed, **G**reen, and **B**lue. OpenCV generally uses **BGR**: Blue, Green, Red.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is just one of the many ways we can represent an image. In an RGB image, we get a pixel by mixing the three colors. We can get the same pixel by using different numbers and formulae to combine them. For instance, the **CMYK** color space encodes each pixel in 4 primary colors: **C**yan, **M**agenta, **Y**ellow and **K**ey (Black). Since printers use these primary colors, CMYK is often used when preparing images for print.\n",
        "\n",
        "Not all color spaces consist only of primary colors. For instance, **HSV** (**H**ue, **S**aturation, **V**alue) stores the color in Hue, the color's intensity in Saturation, and the general brightness of that pixel in Value. The Hue portion is a number in [0, 179] (in OpenCV, usually it's an arc around a circle, so [0, 360)) where 0 is red, and the hue slowly shifts to green and then blue as you get to higher numbers.\n",

        "You can think of the whole HSV color space as a cylinder. The height on the cylinder corresponds to how dark the pixel is, the distance from the center tells you how non-gray it is, and the angle tells you which color the pixel is.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many color spaces each with its uses. One other color space we'll mention in **YCbCr**. Y is the **luma** component, similar to the Value in HSV. Cb is the **blue-difference chroma component**, i.e. how blue should this pixel be tinted. Similarly, Cr is the **red-difference chroma component**, which tells you how much should a pixel be tinted red. Even with a different type of representation, each YCbCr is capable of showing all RGB images.\n",

        "\n",
        "The reason YCbCr is important is because of the human eye. Our eyes are much more sensitive to luminance than actual color differences. Therefore, when compressing images, it's better to compress the chroma components than luminance if you want the image to look the same to a human observer.  This is called **chroma subsampling** and is used heavily in image and video compression, including MPEG, JPEG, DVD and Blu-Rays, and many others.\n",

You can see all the color conversion codes [here](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d8/d01/group__imgproc__color__conversions.html#ga4e0972be5de079fed4e3a10e24ef5ef0). For example:\n",
