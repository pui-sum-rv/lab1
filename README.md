<p>An excellent tutorial for getting started with Python can be found at
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/introduction.html"> official pages</a>.</p>
<h2>Python Basics</h2>
<p>Python is a very powerful and popular programming language. It was created back in 1990, and its popularity continues to grow. Python is an interpreted language, which means it runs without the need for compilation. Additionally, Python features automatic memory allocation, similar to languages like Ruby and Smalltalk. </p>

<p>Python allows writing scripts into files that execute the entire script at once, but it also enables writing code directly in the Python interpreter line by line, executing the code immediately. This mode is convenient for testing and verifying language functionality, as it provides direct language <em>feedback</em>. 
This mode of operation is similar to executing MATLAB commands line by line. </p>

<h4>Starting the interpreter </h4>
<p>We can start the Python interpreter by entering the command </p>
<pre class="konzola">python3</pre>

<p>in command window. A text similar to this appears: </p>
<pre>
Python 3.6.9 (default, Oct  8 2020, 12:12:24) 
[GCC 8.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>These three characters "&gt;&gt;&gt;" indicate where we will write the command in the interpreter. In this document, the commands we enter into the interpreter will also be written in a text box, but they will have characters "&gt;&gt;&gt;" in front of them.</p>
<p>Lets write the first Python command <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">print</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="str">"Hello World!"</span></code> like in the next example: </p>
<pre class="interpreter">&gt;&gt;&gt; print ("Hello World!")
Hello World!</pre>

<p>The result of printing a string <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="str">"Hello World!"</span></code> is a text that is shown below the 
command execution. </p>
<p>Printing to the console in Python is very straightforward. The command <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">print</span></code> takes one or more arguments separated by commas. Examples: </p>
<pre class="interpreter">&gt;&gt;&gt; print ("Hello", "World")
Hello World
</pre>
<pre class="interpreter">&gt;&gt;&gt; print ("Hello", "World", "Math", 2+2)
Hello World Math 4
</pre>
<pre class="interpreter">&gt;&gt;&gt; print ("Hello", "World", "Math", 2**5)
Hello World Math 32
</pre>

<p>In the example above, we see the use of the print command. Since Python is an object-oriented
oriented language, most of the objects we will encounter in Python have defined method <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">__str__</span></code> a method that defines how it will be represented as a string. The command <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">print</span></code> converts all parameters separated by commas into corresponding strings and prints them out.</p>
<p>In the second example, we see that the fourth argument to the command <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">print</span></code> 
sum of two numbers, <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="lit">2</span><span class="pun">+</span><span class="lit">2</span></code>. 
We see that the printed result is <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="lit">4</span></code>. Likewise, in the third example, we see
that: <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="lit">2</span><span class="pun">**</span><span class="lit">5</span></code>, the Python notation for representing an exponent. Thus, the result printed by `print` is <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="lit">32</span></code>. </p>
<p>We can also use the Python interpreter as a calculator, where mathematical expressions can be written directly in the interpreter. Example:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; 8+4
12
&gt;&gt;&gt; 8*4
32
&gt;&gt;&gt; 8**4
4096
&gt;&gt;&gt; 8**4 + 8*4
4128
&gt;&gt;&gt; 8**4 + 8*4 + 8+4
4140
</pre>

<p>In the interpreter, it is not necessary to use the `print` command <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">print</span></code>  to print the value of a variable; you can simply type the variable name, and the interpreter will provide the same output as with the `print` command.  <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">print</span></code>. Although it is not incorrect to use
<code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">print</span></code>. </p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "Hello Computer Vision!"
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
Hello Computer Vision!
</pre>


<h4>Automatic memory management</h4>
<p>Automatic memory management means that memory for a variable is allocated when a value is assigned to that variable. In Python, it is neither necessary nor possible to define a variable beforehand without assigning it a value. An example from the C language: <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">int</span><span class="pln"> a</span><span class="pun">;</span></code>  will allocate memory for an integer variable <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">a</span></code>, but it will not assign a value to it. In Python, a variable is defined when a value is assigned to it, and Python will automatically determine the type of the variable based on the assigned value. Similarly, a variable in Python can change its type dynamically. Let's look at the following example:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; a=10
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (a)
10
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "Hello World!"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (a)
Hello World!
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = a * 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (a)
Hello World!Hello World!
</pre>

<p>In this example, we can see that the variable <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">a</span></code> is initially created as an integer because an integer value is assigned in the first line of the above example. After that, the same variable <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">a</span></code> is assigned a string, and now the variable holds the value of that string, losing the integer value it previously had. 
The third command multiplies variable <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">a</span></code> with 2. Since the varible <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">a</span></code>  is defined as a string and repeated that many times, we see that the result of this operation is <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="typ">Hello</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">World</span><span class="pun">!</span><span class="typ">Hello</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">World</span><span class="pun">!</span></code>.</p>
<h2>Data literals</h2>
<h4>Additional documentation:</h4>
<p>For more information on data types, see:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html">official Python documentation.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/docs.html#tabs-Python">On CodeSkulptor.org</a>
a concise and comprehensive documentation is available.</p>
<h4>Types</h4>
<p>Python supports three basic complex data types. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>list</li>
<li>dictionary</li>
<li>tuple</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of them can contain any other data type as an element. For instance, we can have a list of dictionaries or a list of tuples, and so on. Also, not all elements within a data structure need to be of the same type. For example, we can have a list where the first element is a tuple and the second is a dictionary.</p>
<h4>list</h4>
<p>A list is defined using square brackets. Let's look at the following example:</p>

<pre>
>>> a = []
>>> print (a)
[]
>>> a = [2, 3, [2, 4] ]
>>> print (a)
[2, 3, [2, 4]]
>>> a[0] = [3, 4]
>>> print (a)
[[3, 4], 3, [2, 4]]
>>> a[2] = 0
>>> print (a)
[[3, 4], 3, 0]
>>> b = a[0]
>>> print (b)
[3, 4] 
>>> b[0] = 999
>>> print (a)
[[999, 4], 3, 0]
</pre> 

<ul>
<li>Line 1 defines an empty list. </li>
<li>Line 4 defines new list  whose elements are the integers 2 and 3, and another list whose elements are 2 and 4.</li>
<li>Line 7 sets element 0 to a new list. Now, the list in the variable <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">a</span></code>
contains two lists and one integer value. </li>
<li>Line 10 sets the second element of the list to 0. Although there was a complex data type at index 2, this command simply replaces it with another value. </li>
<li>Line 13 assigns <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">b</span></code> the first element of the list to the variable <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">a</span></code>. </li>
<li>Line 16 changes the value of the first element of the list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">b</span></code> to 999, and since the whole list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">b</span></code> zapravo isti objekt kao i nulti element liste <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">a</span></code>,
vidimo da se promjena odražava i na nju. </li>
</ul>
<p>An element of a list can be any object. By assigning a list element to a variable, that variable refers to exactly that object. If we later change that object, the change will also be reflected within the list.</p>

<pre>
>>> a = ["pero", "djuro", "marko"]
>>> a
['pero', 'djuro', 'marko']
>>> a[0] = "miki"
>>> a
['miki', 'djuro', 'marko']
>>> a[0][0]
'm'
>>> a[0][0] = "p"
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
</pre>

<p>In this example, we see access to elements at a secondary level within the list. In this case, the string <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="str">"miki"</span></code> is assigned to the zero-th element of the list, and in line 7 we access its zero-th character. Strings in Python largely behave like lists of characters, allowing access to individual elements or iteration through them in loops. We also see an interesting property of strings in Python, which is that they are immutable. Once created, a string cannot be modified in memory. In line 1, we created a list with three elements, all of which are strings. In line 3, we changed the zero-th element from <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="str">"pero"</span></code> to <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="str">"miki"</span></code>. However, we did not change the original string in memory. We simply created a new string in memory and set the zero-th element of the list to this new string. In line 7, we see how to access the zero-th character of the string <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="str">"miki"</span></code>, but in line 9 we see that this character cannot be changed. We could create a new string and set it in place of the existing string, but directly modifying the value inside a string is impossible in Python.</p>
<h5>Adding to a list</h5>
<p>Let's look at the following two examples:</p>

<pre>
>>> ulice = []
>>> ulice.append("osjecka")
>>> ulice.append("zagrebacka")
>>> ulice.append("rijecka")
>>> ulice
['osjecka', 'zagrebacka', 'rijecka']
>>> ulice+="trpimirova"
>>> ulice
['osjecka', 'zagrebacka', 'rijecka', 't', 'r', 'p', 'i', 'm', 'i', 'r', 'o', 'v', 'a']
</pre>

<pre>
>>> ulice = []
>>> jednosmjerne = []
>>> jednosmjerne.append("trpimirova")
>>> jednosmjerne.append("branimirova")
>>> jednosmjerne.append("osjecka")
>>> jednosmjerne
['trpimirova', 'branimirova', 'osjecka']
>>> ulice += jednosmjerne
>>> ulice
['trpimirova', 'branimirova', 'osjecka']
>>> ulice.append(jednosmjerne)
>>> ulice
['trpimirova', 'branimirova', 'osjecka', ['trpimirova', 'branimirova', 'osjecka']]
</pre>

<p>In the first example, we have an empty list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ulice</span></code> to which we add strings using the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">append</span><span class="pun">()</span></code> function. The <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">append</span></code> function adds each given string as an object, and each string then takes up one element of the list. We see that by adding three strings, the list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ulice</span></code> now has 3 elements, which are the given strings (line 6). Now look at line 7, where we add another string to the list, but this time using the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pun">+=</span></code> operator. This time, each element of the string is added separately to the list. Since a string behaves like a list of characters, <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pun">+=</span></code> adds each character of the string individually to the list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ulice</span></code>.</p>
<p>It might be clearer in the second example. Here, we see that <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pun">+=</span></code> adds each element of the list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">jednosmjerne</span></code> to the list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ulice</span></code> as separate elements, while <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">append</span><span class="pun">()</span></code> adds the entire list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">jednosmjerne</span></code> to the list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">ulice</span></code> as a single element.</p>

<h4>tuple</h4>
<p>The next data type we will describe is the <em>tuple</em>. A tuple is specific in that it is immutable. It can have an unlimited number of elements. Once the values within a tuple are set, they can no longer be changed. So, if we create a tuple that contains two objects, it is no longer possible to add a new object or delete one of the objects from the tuple. However, this does not mean that the objects within the tuple cannot be changed. What is guaranteed is that the tuple will always contain the objects with which it was created, regardless of what is now stored within those objects.</p>

<pre>
>>> a = [ 1, 2]
>>> b = [3 ,4]
>>> c = (a,b)
>>> c
([1, 2], [3, 4])
>>> c[0] = 7
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
>>> a[0] = 7
>>> c
([7, 2], [3, 4])
</pre>

<p>In this example, we see the creation of two lists within the variables <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">a</span></code> and <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">b</span></code>, and we create a tuple <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">c</span></code> that contains these two lists. If we try to change the zero-th element of the tuple <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">c</span></code>, we will get an error. However, we see that we can change the zero-th element of the list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">a</span></code> without any problem, and since the list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">a</span></code> is an object contained in the tuple <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">c</span></code>, the change is also visible in the tuple.</p>

<h4>dictionary</h4>

<p>The third type of literal is a dictionary. It is a data type similar to a list, but instead of accessing elements by index like in a list, we access them by key. Each element in a dictionary has a key and a value (key-value store). The key can be any immutable object in Python. New elements are added to a dictionary by assigning an object to a key. Example:</p>

<pre>
>>> godine = {}
>>> godine
{}
>>> godine["pero"] = 17
>>> godine["djuro"] = 19
>>> godine
{'pero': 17, 'djuro': 19}
>>> godine["metuzalem"] = 139
>>> godine
{'metuzalem': 139, 'pero': 17, 'djuro': 19}
>>> godine["metuzalem"] = [1,3,9]
>>> godine
{'metuzalem': [1, 3, 9], 'pero': 17, 'djuro': 19}
>>> godine["pero"]
17
>>> godine["metuzalem"][1]
3
</pre>

<p>Line 1 creates an empty dictionary. We see that even though it is empty, when assigning an object to a non-existent key, that key is automatically created and assigned that object. If the key already exists, the given object will be stored at that place in the dictionary, overwriting the old value (line 11; the value <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="lit">139</span></code> under the key <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">metuzalem</span></code> is replaced with the list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pun">[</span><span class="lit">1</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="lit">3</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="lit">9</span><span class="pun">]</span></code>. Thus, we see that different data types can be stored as values associated with a key. Like other literals, there is no limit to the number of elements in a dictionary.</p>
<p>Another important difference between a dictionary and a list is that a dictionary does not guarantee the order of elements. The order in which they are added may not be the order in which they are stored. In contrast, a list always maintains the order of its elements. This is important when iterating through lists and dictionaries in loops.</p>

<h3>Loops in Python</h3>
<p>The loops in Python are the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">for</span></code> loop and the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">while</span></code> loop. Python does not use <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pun">;</span></code> at the end of a statement or curly braces to separate code blocks. This is managed in Python by indentation.</p>
<h4><code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">while</span></code></h4>
<p>In the following example, we see that the statements inside the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">while</span></code> loop are indented by 4 spaces. Python uses the indentation of individual lines of code to determine which block they belong to. We see that the condition in the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">while</span></code> loop is not enclosed in parentheses, unlike in the C language. Also, note the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pun">:</span></code> after the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">while</span></code> statement. This indicates the beginning of a new sub-block of statements. To end a block, there is no use of <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">end</span></code> or anything similar; instead, the block ends when the indentation ends. Lines 3 and 4 are inside the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">while</span></code> loop, while line 6 is outside. It will be executed only when the loop is finished.</p>
<p>The <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">while</span></code> loop in Python works in the way we are used to in C. It executes the block of statements within it as long as the condition at the beginning of the loop is true.</p>

<pre>
n = 10
while n > 1:
    print (n)
    n -= 1
 
print ("finished")
</pre>

Ispis:
<pre>10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
finished
</pre>


<h4><code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">for</span></code></h4>
<p>The <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">for</span></code> statement in Python works differently from what we are used to in C. So far, we have needed to define a counter, determine the iteration step, and specify the condition under which execution will stop. In fact, the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">for</span></code> loop in C is functionally quite similar to the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">while</span></code> loop. In Python, however, the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">for</span></code> loop is used differently. Here, the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">for</span></code> loop is used to iterate over a sequence. Certain data types (such as strings and lists) are essentially sequences of data, and the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">for</span></code> loop iterates through the elements of these sequences in the order in which they appear.</p>

<pre>
sek = ["pero", "djuro", "marko", "miki"]
     
for i in sek:
    print (i, len(i))
</pre>

Print:
<pre>
pero
4
djuro
5
marko
5
miki
4
</pre>

<p>This example shows how iteration is done using the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">for</span></code> statement. The loop takes each element from the list one by one, assigns it to the variable <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">i</span></code>, and this variable is then available within the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">for</span></code> block for further operations.</p>
<p><code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">for</span></code> blocks can also be nested (one inside the other). In the following example, the outer <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">for</span></code> loop takes each element from the list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">sek</span></code>, while the inner <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">for</span></code> loop takes each character of the string <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">i</span></code> and assigns it to the variable <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">slovo</span></code>.</p>

<pre>
sek = ["pero", "djuro", "marko", "miki"]
     
for i in sek:
  for slovo in i:
    print (slovo)
</pre>

Print: 
<pre>
p
e
r
o
d
j
u
r
o
m
a
r
k
o
m
i
k
i
</pre>

<h4><code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">range</span></code></h4>
<p><code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">range</span></code> is a Python function that returns a sequence representing a range of numbers.</p>

<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(range(10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(range(2, 8))
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(range(2, 8, 3))
[2, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(range(2, 9, 3))
[2, 5, 8]
</pre>

<p>When only one parameter is passed to the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">range</span></code> function, it indicates up to which value the function will return a range of numbers. The number given as the end value of the range is never included in the range. The number from which the range starts is included in the returned range, and by default, it starts at 0.</p>
<p>If the function call has two parameters, then the first parameter is the starting value of the range (included in the range), and the second parameter is the end value (not included in the range).</p>
<p>If the function call has three parameters, the first two are as in the previous case, and the third parameter is the step of the range.</p>
<p>Using the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">range</span></code> function, we can use a <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">for</span></code> loop in a manner similar to how it would be used in C.</p>

<pre>
for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  printf("%d\n", i);
}
</pre>
<p> Equivalent notation in Python: </p>
<pre>
for i in range(10):
    print (i)
</pre>

<p>We could also iterate through a list using the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">range</span></code> function. In this case, the variable <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">i</span></code> will contain the current index, and we can access the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">i</span></code>-th element of the list using <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">list[i]</span></code>.</p>

<pre>
lista = [ "a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa", "aaaaa" ]
for i in range(len(lista)):
    print (lista[i])
</pre>

<p>However, in such cases, it is simpler to use the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">enumerate</span></code> function, which returns a tuple containing the current index and the element at that index.</p>

<pre>
lista = [ "a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa", "aaaaa" ]
for (i,x) in enumerate(lista):
    print (i) # i je index
    print (x) # x je element value
</pre>

<h3>Conditions</h3>
<p>Python supports <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">if</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">-</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">else</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">if</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">-</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">else</span></code> conditions. The syntax is as shown in the following example.</p>

<pre>
n= 10
if n > 7:
    print "bigger than 7"
elif n > 5:
    print "between 7 i 5"
else: 
    print "5 or less"
</pre>


<p>It is possible to compare more complex objects, not just numbers and letters. Example:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; ime = "Pero"

<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>In the following example, there is a function that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a number given as a parameter.</p>
<pre>
def fib(n):    
    """Prints the Fibonacci sequence from 0 to n"""
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        print(a)
        a, b = b, a+b
</pre>

In the following example, we see how to call this function and the result it would print.
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; fib(2000)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597
</pre>

<p>In the example of this function, we see a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The keyword used to define a function is <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">def</span></code></li>
<li><code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="str">""" text within triple quotes """</span></code> is called a <em>documentation string</em>. It is placed at the very beginning of the function and serves to describe the inputs and outputs of the function, as well as provide a comment on the function's purpose.</li>
<li>Line 3 shows Python's way of <em>multiple assignment</em>, i.e., assigning values to multiple variables simultaneously.</li>
<li>We see that the function does not return any value but performs the printing itself. Actually, this is not entirely true—every function in Python returns a value. If there is no explicit <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">return</span></code> statement, then the return value of the function is <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">None</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we wanted a function that would return the values of the Fibonacci sequence instead of printing them, such a function would look like the following example:</p>

<pre>
def fib2(n): 
    """Returns a list containing the Fibonacci sequence from 0 to n"""
    result = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        result.append(a)    
        a, b = b, a+b
    return result
</pre>

In the following example, we see how to call this function and the result it would print.
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; f = fib2(2000)  # calls the function and stores the value in variable f
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f)        # prints the variable f, i.e., the return value from the function
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597]
</pre>

<p>This function returns the list <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">result</span></code>, to which the values of the Fibonacci sequence are added one by one in each iteration of the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">while</span></code> loop. The statement <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">f </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> fib</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="lit">2000</span><span class="pun">)</span></code> calls the function and stores the return value in the variable <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">f</span></code>.</p>

<h2>Keyboard Input</h2>
<h4>Additional Documentation</h4>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/inputoutput.html">Tutorial for input/output</a> on the official site.</p>

<h4>input</h4>
<p>Keyboard input in Python is done using the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">input</span><span class="pun">()</span></code> function. This function reads text from the keyboard, and its return value is the entered text, returned as a string. Thus, if we want to store the entered text, we need to assign its return value to a variable. It can accept a string parameter, which will be displayed before requesting input. Example:</p>

<pre>
    >>> n = input()
    upisujemo neki tekst
    >>> n
    'upisujemo neki tekst'
    >>> a = input("Upiši neki tekst: ")
    Upiši neki tekst: upisujemo neki tekst
    >>> a
    'upisujemo neki tekst'
    >>> x = input("upisi broj: ")
    upisi broj: 7
    >>> x
    '7'
    >>> x = int(input("upisi broj: ") )
    upisi broj: 7
    >>> x
    7
</pre>

<p>From the above example, we can see that the entered text is always a string. If we want it as a number, we need to explicitly convert it to a number. We can do this using the <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">int</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">)</span></code> command (as in line 13).</p>

<h2>Including Additional Modules</h2>
<p>In Python, it is very easy to include additional modules that provide extra functionalities. The command used for this is <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="kwd">import</span></code>.</p>
<pre>
import math
import random
</pre>
<p>The <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">math</span></code> module provides access to functions from the C library for working with floating-point mathematics.</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.cos(math.pi / 4.0)
0.70710678118654757
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.log(1024, 2)
10.0
</pre>

<p>The <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">random</span></code> module allows working with random numbers.</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice(['apple', 'pear', 'banana'])
'apple'
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.random()    # random float
0.17970987693706186
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.randrange(6)    # random integer chosen from range(6)
4

<p>Python supports array slicing, which is a technique that allows us to return only specific parts of an array. The <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pun">:</span></code> symbol means "all from this dimension".</p>
<ul>
<li>The first example returns the first row and first column, but all values from the third dimension, which defines the image channels (BGR). Thus, the returned values in this case are the BGR values of the pixel at (0,0).</li>
<li>The second example returns the same, but for the pixel at (1,1).</li>
<li>The third example returns the same, but for the pixel at (128,128).</li>
<li>The fourth example returns the first row, all pixel values from the columns in the first row, and for each of them, only the value of the blue channel.</li>
<li>The fifth example returns all pixels of the image, but only the first channel, i.e., blue.</li>
<li>The sixth example returns the values of the red channel for all pixels of the image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Python can also return specific ranges. Ranges are defined by numbers before and after the colon symbol  <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pun">:</span></code>.</p>

<h4>Mathematical Operations on Arrays</h4>
<p>It is possible to perform mathematical operations on all elements of an array. Similarly, you can select a specific part of the array using slicing and perform operations only on that part.</p>

<p>Another very useful feature of Python and NumPy when working with arrays is the ability to use conditions within <code class="prettyprint lang- prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pun">[</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">]</span></code> (square brackets).</p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted" style=""><span class="pln">image</span><span class="pun">[</span><span class="pln">image</span><span class="pun">&lt;</span><span class="lit">100</span><span class="pun">]</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">255</span></pre>

<p>This line will iterate through all the values in the image array, check each value, and if it is less than 100, it will set that value to 255.</p>
